# Learn Modern JavaScript Methods by Building Football Team Cards

One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. Learned how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project covered concepts like, default parameters, Object.freeze(), and reinforced my knowledge of the switch statement and map() method.
