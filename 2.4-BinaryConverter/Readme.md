# Learn Recursion by Building a Decimal to Binary Converter

Built a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. Learned the fundamental concepts of recursion and call stack. Also built out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.
